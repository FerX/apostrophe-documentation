## Inherits from: [apostrophe-module](../apostrophe-module/README.md)
Pushes utility methods to the browser as the `apos.utils` singleton. This module
is separate from [apostrophe-utils](../apostrophe-utils/index.html) because that
module is initialized very early, before it is possible to push assets to the browser.
