# Setting up your environment

## Setting up your environment

Let's start from the very beginning by installing the software necessary to develop with Apostrophe. After that, we'll set up an empty Apostrophe site.

### Install the Software

**These instructions are for MacOS X v10.9 or later.** MacOS X is the preferred platform for Apostrophe CMS development. Windows users can use this lovely [HOWTO for Windows](../howtos/windows.md) contributed by Michael Brown to get everything setup. Linux users can get going by installing the same operating system packages required by our [deployment HOWTO](../intermediate/deployment.md).

First we'll install the following software:

* XCode \(required for all compilation on Macs\)
* Homebrew \(for easy installing\)
* Git
* Node & NPM
* MongoDB
* Optional: Imagemagick \(for fast image manipulation with animated GIF support\)

#### Install XCode

Launch the "Terminal" app. From this point on, anything `formatted like this` is meant to be run at the terminal prompt. Basic familiarity with the terminal is very helpful for node and Apostrophe development.

#### XCode Command Line Tools

You will also need the Xcode Command Line Tools, which can be installed by going to Xcode -&gt; Preferences ... -&gt; Downloads. This installs the XCode command line tools directly from Apple. You *do not* have to install the full XCode user interface.

#### Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a convenient software manager that makes it easier to keep track of and update your software packages.

Install Homebrew by copying and pasting this one-line command to the terminal:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

_Trouble? Visit the_ [_Homebrew site_](http://brew.sh/) _for the latest instructions._

#### Install Node

One command is all it takes:

```bash
brew install node
```

#### Adjust your PATH

The terminal prompt finds commands in folders listed in an environment variable called PATH. We'll need to add node's directory to our $PATH in order for it to work its magic.

Create a plaintext file called `.profile` in your home directory if you don't already have one and open it with your text editor \(which will default to TextEdit on a Mac, which is fine\):

```bash
touch ~/.profile && open ~/.profile
```

In this new file, add these two lines:

```bash
export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node"
export PATH="/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH"
```

You should verify that this worked by opening a _new_ Terminal tab and running:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

It should echo the current PATH setting as a set of colon-separated values, beginning with your additions.

#### Install NPM \(Node Package Manager\)

NPM may or may not have been installed with Node. Try:

```bash
npm
```

If you get a "not found" error, run this:

```bash
curl -L https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
```

#### Install git

You'll need git to manage your source code. Macs come with it, but we suggest you get the latest via homebrew:

```bash
brew install git
```

#### Install MongoDB

Apostrophe used MongoDB for persistence. You can install it with homebrew. In addition, you can configure `brew services` to launch it automatically for you, so you don't have to fuss with restarting it manually.  First you need to install the "tap" for Mongo DB:

```brew tap mongodb/brew
```
Then you can install MongoDB:

```brew install mongodb-community
```

After it is installed, start the MongoDB service:

```brew services start mongodb-community
```

Now open a **new terminal window** and try:

```bash
mongo
```

It should start an interactive mongo prompt. ctrl+c to exit.

> "Hey, I got a connection failed error!" Make sure you ran `brew services start mongodb-community`.

#### Install ImageMagick

```bash
brew install imagemagick
```

Now you have the `convert` and `identify` command line tools, which Apostrophe uses to scale and crop images quickly, with animated GIF support. _If you skip this step, Apostrophe can still handle image uploads more slowly, thanks to_ [_Jimp_](https://npmjs.org/package/jimp)_._

## Build a website!

Now your environment is configured it's time to create our first Apostrophe project.
