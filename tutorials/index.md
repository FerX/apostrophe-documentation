## Getting Started

[The "getting started" tutorials](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-documentation/tree/e71017392b54a258d8d72811456c862139150a96/tutorials/getting-started/index.html) are written for developers who are new to Apostrophe. They will walk you through the process of getting your environment set up, creating a basic website, and even diving deeper into some of the more advanced features.

Practical examples of these concepts are illustrated in the [Open Musuem project, a fully featured Apostrophe site](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-open-museum), which you can clone to your machine or [try a live demo](http://demo.apostrophecms.org).

## Intermediate

[The "intermediate" tutorials](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-documentation/tree/e71017392b54a258d8d72811456c862139150a96/tutorials/intermediate/index.html) are geared toward developers who are more comfortable with Apostrophe and node.js.

## HOWTOs

[The HOWTOs](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-documentation/tree/e71017392b54a258d8d72811456c862139150a96/tutorials/howtos/index.html) cover miscellaneous topics like configuring the admin bar, adding a field to every type of piece at once, and running Apostrophe under Windows.

## What's the right level for me?

Feel free to skip around after you complete the [getting started](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-documentation/tree/e71017392b54a258d8d72811456c862139150a96/tutorials/getting-started/index.html) series. Just keep in mind the material does tend to build on previous tutorials.
