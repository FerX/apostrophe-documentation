# `checkboxes`

A `checkboxes` field presents an array of checkboxes. Its value is an array containing the values of the selected checkboxes.


## Fields and widgets: editing the field "in context" on the page

You may also want to set `contextual: true` so the field does not *also* appear in the dialog box for the widget. But, you don't have to.
